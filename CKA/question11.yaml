# This is file question11.yaml

change the image name and also mount path 

kubectl get pod nginx-cka01-trb -o yaml
Under containers: check the command: section, this is the command which is failing. If you notice its looking for the logs under /var/log/httpd/ directory but the mounted volume for logs is /var/log/nginx (under volumeMounts:). So we need to fix this path:

kubectl get pod nginx-cka01-trb -o yaml > /tmp/test.yaml
vi /tmp/test.yaml
Under command: change /var/log/httpd/access.log and /var/log/httpd/error.log to /var/log/nginx/access.log and /var/log/nginx/error.log respectively.

Delete the existing POD now:

kubectl delete pod nginx-cka01-trb
Create new one from the template

kubectl apply -f /tmp/test.yaml
Let's check now if the POD is in Running state

kubectl get pod
It should be good now. So let's try to access the app.

curl http://kodekloud-exam.app:30001
You will see error

curl: (7) Failed to connect to kodekloud-exam.app port 30001: Connection refused
So you are not able to access the website, et's look into the service configuration.

Edit the service
kubectl edit svc nginx-service-cka01-trb -o yaml 
Change app label under selector from httpd-app-cka01-trb to nginx-app-cka01-trb
You should be able to access the website now.
curl http://kodekloud-exam.app:30001
